# How to Host an Online Resume the Right Way With Help From Andrew Etter
### Purpose:
1) To describe the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, the Apostrophe Markdown Editor, GitHub Pages, and Jekyll.
2) To relate the practical steps described above to the general principles of current Technical Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book *Modern Technical Writing*.

### Prerequisites
- a markdown-formatted essay (seem *More Resources* for help with this)
- a GitHub Account
- a markdown editor such as Apostrophe
- Jekyll (built into GitHub)

### Instructions
#### 1) Create your resume
The first thing we need to do is to create a resume, and we will be using the markup language Markdown for this. See the *More Resources* section for instructions on how to use markdown.

Using Markdown has significant advantages for us, both for writing this resume as well as for general technical writing. As Etter explains, its simplicity makes it easy to learn in just a few minutes, whereas a traditional markup language like XML can take weeks to learn, and years of experience to master. Markdown also has the advantage that it is easily readable in its raw, plain text form, which makes for much easier review and editing down the road. 

#### 2) Create your GitHub repository

1) In your GitHub Account, under *Repositories*, click "New"
2) On the *Create a New Repository* page, input the repository name as *YourGithubUsername.github.io*.
3) Make sure that the repository is set to public, and that the options *Add a README file*, *Add .gitignore*, and *Choose a license* are not checked.
4) Click on *Create Repository*
